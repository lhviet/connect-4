# ConnectFour

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.0.

## Development server

Run `yarn dev:w` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `yarn prebuild` to generate HTMLs from Pugs.

- `src/app/components` for UI
- `src/app/containers` play role of Controllers
- `src/app/services` share data and logic
- `src/app/helpers/game-helper.ts` helps to solve complicated things, i.e. check valid positions, check win cases

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

`firebase deploy` will deploy files in `dist`.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
